    Low contrast dark colorschemes.
    No bold. No italic. For very small font. (I'm using 7.5pts font in NotePC)
    Fullcolor gui only.
    Six variations with a feeling of unification. So it is easy to change hh<theme> by session, filetype, account, mood or "Today's Lucky Color".

    Try hhspring first.
